# Deploying Refget Server on AWS with Elastic Container Service and Fargate

## Overview

A containerized instance of the Refget web service can be deployed on AWS using the Elastic Container Service (ECS) and Fargate unmanaged container instances.

An example AWS Cloudformation template for deploying a containerized Refget service through ECS and Fargate is available [here](../../iac/aws/ecs_fargate/template.yaml). The template can be modified to suit additional design considerations.
